Makes
=====

GNU Makefiles Simplified


## Synopsis

Makes automatically installs all dependencies locally inside the current
working directory.

It works on Linux or MacOS (Intel and ARM) without worrying about specifics.

Here's an example Makefile for a Clojure project:

```make
# Set a directory to put the 'makes' repository:
M := .cache/makes
# Auto install the 'makes' repo on first 'make' command:
$(shell [ -d $M ] || git clone -q https://github.com/makeplus/makes $M)

# Include `init.mk` first:
include $M/init.mk

# Include any other deps you need. All installed/cached locally.
include $M/java.mk
include $M/clojure.mk
include $M/lein.mk

# Define your rules:
test repl: $(LEIN)
	lein $@
```

Users just run `make test` out of the box.

They don't need `java`, `clojure` or `lein` installed on their system.
Makes wouldn't use their versions if they did have them installed.

This makes for very reliable builds and testing.


## Overview

Makefiles for complex projects are usually complex.
They need special code to handle different environments.
They need complicated rules to install dependencies.
They don't share code with other Makefiles from other projects.

**Makes** changes all that.

Makefiles that use Makes are generally very short and to the point:
* They name a directory for all the dependencies to be installed.
* They list their dependencies.
* They define their rules making use of lots of predefined rules and variables.

Most of the intricacies are handled by Makes.

Every dependency language or tool has its own `<name>.mk` file in `makes`
repository that does as much of the work as possible for you.


## Caching Installation Assets

Each `<dep>.mk` language/tool dependency for Makes installs the tool from a
release file.
These files can be very large.

If you create a `$HOME/.cache/makes/` directory, these large downloads will
be cached there.


## Using `shell.mk`

If you add a `include $(MAKES)/shell.mk` you will get rules for `make shell`,
`make bash` and `make zsh`.
These will start a subshell after installing all the Makes dependencies you
have already included.


## Using Gists for Makefiles

If you often want to use a language like Rust on various machines but you don't
want to install it first you can make a file like:

```
M := /tmp/makes
export MAKES_LOCAL_DIR := /tmp/local
$(shell [ -d $M ] || git clone -q https://github.com/makeplus/makes $M)
include $M/init.mk
include $M/go.mk
include $M/shell.mk
```

Then turn it into a GitHub gist:
https://gist.github.com/ingydotnet/20b903f984c28f0105739205f25400b1

Now you can run this anywhere and have a shell with Go tools installed:

```bash
$ go version
Command 'go' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo snap install go         # version 1.24.4, or
sudo apt  install golang-go  # version 2:1.21~2
sudo apt  install gccgo-go   # version 2:1.21~2
See 'snap info go' for additional versions.
$
$ make -f <(curl -sL https://gist.github.com/ingydotnet/20b903f984c28f0105739205f25400b1/raw) bash
Installing 'go' locally
curl+ https://go.dev/dl/go1.24.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz > /tmp/local/cache/go1.24.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -C /tmp/local -xzf /tmp/local/cache/go1.24.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv /tmp/local/go /tmp/local/go-1.24.4
touch /tmp/local/go-1.24.4/bin/go

(makes) ~ $ go version
go version go1.24.4 linux/amd64
(makes) ~ $
(makes) ~ $ exit
exit
$ go version  # Go is not installed on your system; just in /tmp/local/
Command 'go' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo snap install go         # version 1.24.4, or
sudo apt  install golang-go  # version 2:1.21~2
sudo apt  install gccgo-go   # version 2:1.21~2
See 'snap info go' for additional versions.
$
$ # Next time you run this, Go is already installed:
$ make -f <(curl -sL https://gist.github.com/ingydotnet/20b903f984c28f0105739205f25400b1/raw) bash
(makes) ~ $ go version
go version go1.24.4 linux/amd64
(makes) ~ $
```

Need a specific Go version?

```bash
$ make -f <(curl -sL https://gist.github.com/ingydotnet/20b903f984c28f0105739205f25400b1/raw) bash GO-VERSION=1.23.4
Installing 'go' locally
curl+ https://go.dev/dl/go1.23.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz > /tmp/local/cache/go1.23.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -C /tmp/local -xzf /tmp/local/cache/go1.23.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv /tmp/local/go /tmp/local/go-1.23.4
touch /tmp/local/go-1.23.4/bin/go

(makes) ~ $ go version
go version go1.23.4 linux/amd64
(makes) ~ $
```

All of this works for any language, not just Go.
And yes, you can include as many languages as you want into the Makefile.
